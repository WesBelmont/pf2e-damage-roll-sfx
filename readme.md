## Crash Bang Splat

This module changes the sound effects for damage cards in the chat based on physical weapon damage or spell tradition.  
Will hopefully add spell damage types in future. Send me some sfx if you think they are good (and free to use)

The module xdy-pf2e-workbench is not a requirement, but highly reccommended for the auto roll damage, which this module is designed to complement.
